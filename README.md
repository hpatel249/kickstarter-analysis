# kickstarter-analysis

##OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:

 ###The purpose of this analysis was to be able to edit and refactor the code to loop through all the data one time and collect the information needed for larger data sets. Which when successfully done makes the VBA script run faster.

## RESULTS

 ###Comparing the stock performance for both 2017 and 2018 we see that the return percentages for 2017 are positive meaning a profit in most tickers except TERP which is at -7.2% indicating a percentage loss, whereas in 2018 based on the total daily volume the return percentages are in the negative indicating percentage loss except for ENPH and RUN ticker which show a positive return.






 ### After refactoring the code, the execution times compared to the original script is much lower for both 2017 and 2018 meaning that the refactored script ran faster.
     
      

## Summary 

 ### Some advantages of refactoring code are that it makes the code easier to understand, easier to maintain also making it more flexible which increases the capability of the code overall. Some of the disadvantages of refactoring code include it being very time consuming and the higher chance of mistakes due to the complexity of the code.

###These pros and cons applied to refactoring the original VBA script as it reduced the code run time and made it faster. The cons included a lot of time being spend solving the problem due to the errors in the original script.
